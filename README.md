Environmental and housing conditions experienced by fish exert profound effects on their biology, physiology, and behavior.  These parameters are important and often overlooked sources of potential variation in experiments, and should be reported in peer-reviewed publications in order to promote scientific reproducibility.  
To that end, here we provide a summary of the environmental conditions in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) tanks at Laboratório de Neurociências e Comportamento "Frederico Guilherme Graeff" (LaNeC), located in the Universidade Federal do Sul e Sudeste do Pará, Marabá/PA, Brazil. Included are data on the physico-chemical characteristics of the water, as well health, of zebrafish in separate tanks at LaNeC. This information will be applicable to any study involving zebrafish conducted in one of these three facilities during the reported years.
Files are separated by parameter (physico-chemical vs. health) and year.
